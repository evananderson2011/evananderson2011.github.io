            <br>Money, it should actually be a crime. Growing up in my social and fiscally conservative bubble I never saw the draw of economic socialism, bu more and more I feel as if it is probably the right way to go. To have a government that more responsibly and reliably takes the money I'm forced to give them and increases benefits for all of its citizens (favoring those with more need obviousy) sounds staright awesome. What I can confidently say I am not for is the idea that we need to make health insurance less acesibly for those who already cant afford it, all to give tax benefits to people like myself who are (or at least should be) in a place where money is neary no object. But I say that, and I don't actibely use my money to support these things. I guess its something I just lump into a roll of the government, and my only responsibility is to vote accordingly. But even typing that out I don't believe it... I need to look into this, and understand exactly what I believe around this subject, and make significantly more proactive steps in helping it hapen
            <br>
            <br>Nextly I need to type about my spending habits... I have a minor problem. And that is that I make waayyyy more money than I know what to do with, and thus I do things with it that I do not know. Just throwing it around willy nilly, buying random clothing, gadgets, bags, all sorts of shit. I need to decide on a good budget and STICK TO IT. I think my biggest problem I have right now is that I have three categories: Payments, Savings, Credit Cards. And that is just not a good way to go about it because I have no idea what goes into that credit card category. Like this month its a computer, a shit ton of furniture, and then $800 of who nows what including food, gas, and everything else in life. How can I solve this, what is the correct and best method. I need to talk to people that actually have their shit together, so if you know of anyone, hit me up.
            <br>
            <br>And now for a life update, just to actually make this journal (or whatever is happening here) actually useful to future me. This week I started proactively learning python, the language that will actually be useful as my career continues, which perl would not be. Its going well, but I just feel weird and lazy when I work on it at work, like I should be doing something else, but there legitimately is nothing else for me to do. I hope sometime down the road I can show how this is useful so that anybody seeing me work on the learning process can be shown it was work related and beneficial to all. We shall see. This week Emily and I also talked a lot (read more than "not at all") about physical intimacy and sex, and what we think we should do (hehe) around it. The decision we came to was that she should go on birth control, and we make the next necessary decisions from there. But even that decision is stressful af to me. I don't know why, but making a conscious decsion to have sex feels wrong. But then again what we currently do, which is a not conscious decision and just do it anyway, is even worse. I just don't know how to think about this or who I could talk to to flesh all my thoughts out. Cleve is the first person to come to mind, but he seems to have cut off the texting. This week was also my first in the new house! Tucker was the only one around this week, but I think he and I are going to get along really well. He definitely is still viewing me as "just a roommate", but I'm hoping/expecting that that will change with time and we'll begin to actively hang out as well. Hopefully I can even get him nto climbing and can have a black cliffs buddy living with me! Ian is still very much up in the air, from the interactions we've had and the things of his I've seen around the house, he fits into my mental construct of a small town boy who was too smart to stay. He still has the cheap do-it-yourself attitude that comes with the enviorns he was raised in, which makes him slightly hoarderish and cheapish. But again, this is 100% speculation. Lastly, I'm beginning to stress out about planning my switzerland trip. Theres just a lot of decisions to make in about 2 months... soon.
