            <br> Two days in a row? Who would've thought. I titled this one just based on what has been on my mind over the past few days, and that is the future. What it will look like, where I'll be, what I'll be doing. Its all a huge mystery, like the huge, foreboding, amorphos blob that is sometimes just out of reach, and other times so far off that I can barely see it at all. Its a little bit frustrating to have all of these ideas and vague goals floating around my head, but always feeling that they're just a *bit* too improbable, or just not *quite* the best option for what to do with my life. Bit through all of the thinking about the future, I've realized that the thing I need to decide so that I can have a firm decision foundation is whether I want to strive for material success or stive for maximizing my life experiences. Obviously there is a balance of the two, but at the core of a life is a decision to do one of those two, and maybe you sometimes branch off into the other. 
            <br>
            <br> Pausing to create an aside about an idea I had on a run today. Clearly analysis of large data sets is the way of the future. In my job, I see one incredibly clear place to use big data analysis and neural networks to improve efeciency and product yield, and that is in the RDA data collection. We create a metric crap ton of data every time we scan a wafer. and we literally just toss 80% of the data, and we use even less of that for analysis. What if we had a separate database from the klarfhijacker, and to this database we sent a ALL the data. We could then use this data to ID the defect without needing SEM review. It would require a lot of work, we'd need to start collecting all this data, get SEM review to teach the network, have probe confirm the results, and repeat for every. fucking. level. But if we could get it to work, so link a known fail to the inline RDA data that we already collect... that would be truly value added. I'm gonna give Roe and Tripp and call. 
            <br>
            <br>Ok, time to continue pontificating. My gut has been telling me over the past couple days that what I need to do (in approximately 13 months) is abandon my material possesions, pack a bag, and begin my traveling excursions. Who gives a rats ass about what it means for my financial security, I'm only getting older and I can already feel my knees going as I attempt to remain a viable mate for a human female (r/totallynotrobots). I mean if I commit to not spending any more money, like the bare minimum on this euro tour, and then nothing (and I mean nothing? :() else, it could totally happen. Would it require some sacrificing? Absofuckinglutely. But I just signed a lease that will save me $300 a month, and I've set up a direct savings deposit of around $400 am month. Basic maths say thats a lot come 13 months from now, like $4800 a lot. Add on top of that the $6000 i've saved outside of 401k, and I'm sitting on a pretty $10k for a whatever the hell I want tour of the world. My immediate instincts say go to napal and just see what happens, may throw bags at the airport, do IT for a mountaineering firm, who knows. But I really want this. Liek really really bad. The idea of staying in my job, then going to get a masters and immediately starting another jpob thats just slightly more interesting and slightly more money and slightly more working hours sounds like a 3rd to 4th ring of dante's inferno, not quite Satan, but you can sure feel the heat. 
            <br> 
            <br>The question that must be asked though is whether or not this is feasible. I have clear commitments here. First being my relationship with Emily. I don't think she would be too big of a fan of me just up and heading out onto a multi-month finding myself excursion, out of communication and definitely not in any place to further our relationship. But that begs the question, do I even want that? To continue furthering our relationship? Observational logic would say yes, that that is whatmoving forward would look like. I mean we've been dating for between 1.5 to 3 years (depending on who you ask), we talk a lot, spend a lot of money to see each other a lot, and all signs point to the next stage aka marriage. But I really don't know what I feel. IMy emotions and sentiments towards her swing violently from "I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl" to "holy shit I need to bail asap" and that is an incredibly worrying thing. Its all very worrisome to be honest. But alas, I don't what to do with all these thoughts and emotions. Classic me. 
            <br>
            <br>Anyway its pretty late, about time for me to sign off. Hopefully I can keep up the pace on the post, we shall see. I'm also going to start working on a better way to view and navigate these bad boys, possibly just updating a forward/back arrow at the bottom. Rudimentary but usable.
