            <br>Number two here... And I realized my setup is going to be a little weird, because I have no means of remembering the dates on which I wrote these blogs. I may just change it to a number system, literally numerically order the 1 to N and only keep track of dates based off of the text inside. We'll see though <br>
            <br> It was an exciting week, a lot of things happened that are moving me towards having a more normal life out in Boise. First, Tuesday I went climbing. But not at asana just scampering up bouldering problems willy nilly like I usually do, no I was at the black cliffs, with other people! It was awesome to spend time with other people who seemed genuinelly likeable and were not my (direct at least) coworkers. Ben and Tyler and I met up via Micron's climbing club site, and hit ~5 routes on the populace wall. Granted, thats basically the beginners wall (we saw some literal first timers) but it was still a ton of fun getting so real lead climbing back into the routine. Now Ben and I are headed down to City of Rocks next weekend, which should be a blast. It'll probably expose my lack of talent a little bit more than a 5.9 lead did, but hey, he can always set up a top rop for me if it comes down to it. <br>
            <br> Other exciting things, I turned in my officialy 60 days notice to the apartment complex, so I have an official timeline on moving the heck out of that place and finding some new people to live with. Its a waaaayyyy more stressful undertaking than I expected, not knowing anybody and trying my best to find some normal people to spend large amounts of time with. But I'm posting on cragislist, repsonding to folks, and forcing myself to do social things in an attempt to get back into the swing of things. And by things I mean being a social human. I'm also going to start kayaking on tuesday nights. It sounds like the crew that goes is mostly paddling the main, but I'm hoping to find people who are down to hit the staircase after work, fingers crossed. <br>
            <br> The last exciting thing that happened is I bought a plane ticket... a rather odd plane ticket because it takes off in SFO and lands in Zurich! I'll be meeting up with Emily in switzerland for 2 weeks in October, and I psyched about it. It'll be the euro tour I never actually had while I lived over there. I think the plan is to rent a sweet campervan and road trip around the alps, and its going to be amazing! I just have to buy an actual icket to get to SFO first, which means I'll probably hang out with Roe or Lauren and Brad for a little while (also super fun). But basically this week has been full of things that are usually well outside of my comfort zone, and I'm excited to for all of them. And that is a good sign for the future because if I want my life to improve and move in the desirably direction, it'll require me leaving my comfort zone a lot, like a lot a lot.
