            <br>
            <br>This is the first of hpefully many blog posts. They won't be actively linked, becuase as of right now this is only for me, and I don't think the internet cares enough about my active existance to seeking out my thoughts in an active manner. I want to post in on the internet though so that it can be "record" or whatever. In the past I've used journals and notebooks and other methods, but it ever seems to stick because I don't feel any accoutnability. Then once the carthardic feeling of writing out all of my feelings is complete, I drift away from putting my thoughts in words. The dream is for some internet stranger to find this, and be mildly interested in these words enough to continue to bother me about them. Then hopefully this pet project wesite will turn into something that serves are real purpose in my life. We'll see....
            <br>
            <br>The hardest thing about writing done thoughts and emotions is attaching the correct words to those feelings. Its not an easy thing to do, take the complexities of a human psyche, all the hopes and dreams, fears and sorrows, and chemcicals releasing and nuerons firing in the brain and put them into one of millions of boxes we call words. I honestly don't know if there the words we need just aren't there, or if the she magnitude of possibilities that come with language paralyze us an leaves us always feeling like we are not fully understood. If I was a betting man, I'd gues the later. Because choice is a wonderous and terrible thing. It gives us the ability determine our own destiny. We can see the many paths before us, and we can make pick which to follow. Its never easy, its often made without sufficient information, but WE get to choose. And that is incredible. But, and this is a nikki manaj sized but, at the same time choice is devistating. It means that we are responsible for our choices. Whatever we decide, we decided it, we are the route cause of why we are in that scenario, and while people often spend most of there life denying it, the individual alone is what put them in the position they are in today. Choice is like stairing into the abyss, and seeing everything but knowing nothing, and having to step into it whether we want to our not. Choice gives us the ability to seek afte everything we ever wanted, but it denies us the ability to just *be*. And, at least in my life, often that is all I want most in the world.
            <br>
            <br>So, in the face of this great and paralyzing power, what do we do? Isn't that the question of a lifetime, what do we do with the choice we are given. I think there is only thing we can do. Move forward. When life forces into a choice, the worst thing, the last option, the final maneuaver is to be passive. To let life happen to us. If we choose not to choose, we are ruining ourselves. We are making a choice, and its one that more often than not is to our detriment. So my call to myself, to you, is to choose. It doesn't matter what the choice is, if you think its the best or the worst, all that you need to do is take control, and choose. Thats all any of us really need.
