            <br> What? Multiverse? Why the hell is he going to write about that? Well I'll tell you dear internet, I'm going to write about it becasue I listen to podcasts about some seriously random shit, and this was one that was particularly interesting (<a href="http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/2015/11/3/episode-27-the-multiverse">The Liturgists Podcast "Multiverse"</a>) and forces you to confront the intersection of God and physics, specifically how He fits in to the the known theory of everything. So onwards my friends. We are going to focus on Tegmark four levels of multiverse theory. Theres a crap ton of different theories around this, but these four highlight what I think are the most interesting, understandable, and inclusive theories of the multiverse.
            <br>
            <br>LEVELONE. This theoy makes use of what we are going to call our "universe horizon", meaning what cosmically is in our frame of reference. Basically, each of us has our own, individual horizon on which we experience the universe. My current cosimic horizon includes all of the data I am currently taking in and expereincing. The physical space I am occupying (this coffee shop) the sounds I am hearing (bad coutnry music), the thigns I can see (two friends gossiping about a third friends boyfirend) and so on and so forth. This cosmic horizon extends as far as the data that I can intake, so it is drastically impacted by things like the internet, etc. but thats less iportant for the concept. Basically, level one is saying that if the universe is infinite in space, matter, and energy, that every possible comsic hroizon that can exist does, but only within the known laws of physics and universe. This one is cool, but not super exciting. It is basically using the law of large numbers to say anything that is theoretically possible has already happened.
            <br>LEVELTWO. This multiverse starts getting a little more interesting. In its distilled form it is saying that if the universe started at the big bang, all matter and energy began expanding in every direction at greater than the speed of light. But as matter and energy began to slow, it formed little "bubbles" of observable universes, one of which is ours. This theory says that these bubbles have the same basic laws of physics, but may have different initial conditions for the laws. So it describes multiple (infinite) level one ultiverses with different properties of existance. So in one of these multiverses, everything is the same, except the states of matter may be inversted. So we as humans may exists in a gaseous state , but the gases we current move through my exists as solids. Its a little weird to think about, but theoretically possible.
            <br>LEVELTHREE. Now we start to get weird. A level three multiverse is describe as the "many worlds of quantum mechanics". The theory states that every possible outcome has a quantum wave probability distribution. And at every juncture, that probability is played out in a divergent universe. So basically, if every event has random outcome based on a probability, then all of those outcomes occur in parallel but distinct "branches". Its easy to think about in a nodal sense, where I could order a plain black coffee or a chai tea latte, and both of those universes exist in parallel. But in reality, this theory is based on QUANTUM events. So every atom and electron state that could occur based on probablities wave functions IS ocurring. Thats a truely terrifying thought and as Mike and Michael point out really throws a wrench in the idea of free will. Because how can we be making a specific descision id every decision we coul be making is happening, but our current conciousness only exists in the parallel universe that we currently occupy, on to then be split again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again... crazy.
            <br>LEVELFOUR. If you thought three was insane, just wait. This one we cant really explain well, because it exist beyond convential physics or language or human consruct. But essentially, all of the above multiverse are true. And also any convievable ultiverse theory is true. It all exists simultaneously. If you can dream it, it is, based on the quantum probability (maybe?). This one is hard to flesh out any further, so...
            <br>
            <br>So, all this begs the question, in a universe(s) where there are infinite possibilties, is there room for an all knowing all loving God? The easy answer to the qustion is yes, because in infinity there is the possibility for all things. But my gut tells me that this goes beyond that. Like the God that we know and love and are connected to is beyond all of these infinities looking down and loving and guiding us in ways well beyond what our minds and language can express or comprehened. And thats a terrifyingly comforting thought.
