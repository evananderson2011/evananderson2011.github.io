            <br>
            <br> Currently searching for a roommate, which is a stressful task. I am techinically not even moving out for 2 months, and the guys I messaged 5 hours ago and then met with 1 are already asking me to have an answer by friday. The both seem really cool. Tucker is currently working on his masters in english at BSU. He's into surfing and has a serious girlfriend, enough to mention that engagement is on the table. though he is open about being mormon, it wasn't anything like i'd expect from my little knowledge of people who are active in the church of later day saints. He was the one who originally reached out but is definetly the quieter of the two. Gives of the total bro vibe of being cool with just about anything, but once you've crossed a line will let you know. Ian is the other roommate. He's working on his MBA in business and public health. He has a kawasaki 800 that he's wrecked once (yikes), and seems to be the more intellectual of the two. He also gives off the go with the flow vibe, but not in a a surfer dude way that Tucker seemed to have. He seems to be a little more driven, but is definitely bummed that all his friends are getting married and he's left in the dust. I immediately predict being closer to him. The house is 1309 S Vermont, basically 2 blocks south of BSU. Its pretty old, built in 1922 but has two additions. Its 3 bedroom, 2 bath, and has a super open living and kitchen space. My only real concern with the whole situation is the room I'd be in... It's upstairs in a converted attic, and the A/C unit in the just can't handle the extra high up space, I'm not even sure if theres a vent in the wall for it to get air...
            <br>
            <br>Cut to update a week and  half later, I signed a lease with those guys! I'm not rereading what is read above so some of this may be repetitive, but after offering the small room, I basically said "I would, but I'm just not jiving with that room." and Tucker offered to take the small room and give me the big one! Rent is like $525 a month, which is nothing compared to what I'm paying now, and apparently the room huge, like I could have a whole couch and extra chair in there as well. So I'm pretty psyched to live with the se guys, they seem super cool, and chill enough that we'll get along well. If I had to guess I'd say Tucker will be like Lew-Bear, while Ian will be a little closer to the Cleve type. 
            <br>
            <br>Emily wasn't too happy with it, but after I first met with Tucker and Ian I also grabbed coffe with Hannah, another girl who offered up her place as a potential option. While obviously I won't be living with her, she seemed really cool, so I think it'd be awesome to get to know her a little bit better. Female friends, while the enemy of a girlfriend, are people that I seem to get along with a little better. She went out of time for a badass roadtrip down to Zion, so I won't be able to hang for a while, but we shall see. 
            <br>
            <br> Other activities of the past include:
            <br> Heading to City of Rocks national reserve, a climbers paradise where me and two Micron interns shreaded rock until our fingers bled (literally for me). We led 5.8 to 5.10d, and even hit a multi-pitch 5.7 that was a metric crap ton of fun! WE got half way up and realized that tossing rope back down to the prior anchor was not feasible, so we did have to bail, but I got to clean then lead, and also top belay from the anchor at the base of the third pitch, all of which was super friggin cool. 
            <br>Going to Atlanta for the 4th, it was sweaty af, but a ton of fun to hang with Emily and the Fam. I haven't yet decide what all I can talk about on this thing, because I suppose I have no idea who would actually read it... It could really be anyone right? But to give myself a trigger/reminder, Emily and I need to be more intentional about the decisions we make in the heat of the moment. Its not a bad or a good thing necessarily, but it is a thing that must be pre-planned. Seeing the fam was awesome as well, I think I've convinced mom and Emma to come out and see the eclipse in August, which will be super fun! I just hope they actually make it out here, I'd love to be able to spend more time with them.
            <br> Last thing, I bought a mother flippin ticket to Switzerland [+] and I'm psyched! I'll bethere from October 7th through the 21st, and Emily and I are basically just doing the train equivalent of a roadtrip through the Alps. I'll be in paradise the whole time. 
            <br>
            <br>Anyway, in the 2 weeks that I delayed this the tone has changed completely, hopefully I can be more consistent about writing now, once I purchase a new computer I'll be much more inclined to do so.  
            <br>
            <br> Memento Mori,
